# Fullstack Nanodegree Neighborhood Porject

This application is a single page application to show some of my favorite places to eat locally.  I used Knockout.js to build the project.

Second API
======
I chose to use the 4Square API for my second API, as I knew I could get the location details from 4Square.  I also found out that I could create a list within 4Square to save my locations, which allowed me to then get their details and ratings.

Using the App
------
The map is pretty self explanatory.  The search feature allows for basic search against the location's data; such as name, address, etc.
