# Fullstack Nanodegree Neighborhood Porject

This application is a single page application to show some of my favorite places to eat locally.  I used Knockout.js to build the project.

Second API
======
I chose to use the 4Square API for my second API, as I knew I could get the location details from 4Square.  I also found out that I could create a list within 4Square to save my locations, which allowed me to then get their details and ratings.

Using the App
------
+ To get the application running, simply git clone this repository to your local machine.  Navigate to the repo and open the index.html file with your browser.
+ The map is pretty self explanatory.  The search feature allows for basic search against the location's data; such as name, address, etc. 
+ The list of venues is built using the 4Square API, should you not see any venues please make sure you are receiving the appropriate response from the 4Square serve via the network tab.
